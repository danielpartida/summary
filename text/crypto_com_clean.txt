CRO Protocol Labs (“Crypto.com”) intends to operate in full compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations and use its best endeavours to obtain the 
necessary licences and approvals. Regulatory licences and/or approvals are likely 
to be required in a number of relevant jurisdictions in which relevant activities 
may take place. This means that the development and roll-out of all the initiatives 
described in this whitepaper are not guaranteed. It is not possible to guarantee, 
and no person makes any representations, warranties or assurances, that any 
such licences or approvals will be obtained within a particular timeframe or at 
all. As such, the initiatives described in this whitepaper may not be available in 
certain jurisdictions, or at all. This could require restructuring of these initiatives 
and/or its unavailability in all or certain respects. In addition, the development 
of any initiatives is intended to be implemented in stages. During certain stages 
of development, the project may rely on relationships with certain licensed third 
party entities. If these entities are no longer properly licensed in the relevant 
jurisdiction, this will impact the ability of Crypto.com to rely on the services of 
that party.

or any of its affiliates, including any equity, shares, units, royalties to capital,

Risk statements

those listed in any other documentation.
7
Crypto.com
A purchaser should not purchase CRO tokens for speculative or investment 
purposes. Purchasers should only purchase CRO tokens if they fully understand 
the nature of the CRO tokens and accept the risks inherent to the CRO tokens.
Cryptographic tokens may be subject to expropriation and/or theft; hackers 
or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with our 
system/network in various ways, including malware attacks, denial of service 
attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing which 
may result in the loss of your cryptographic tokens or the loss of your ability 
to access or control your cryptographic tokens. In such event, there may be no 
remedy, and holders of cryptographic tokens are not guaranteed any remedy, 
refund, or compensation.
The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens and digital assets is currently 
unsettled, varies among jurisdictions and subject to significant uncertainty. It 
is possible that in the future, certain laws, regulations, policies or rules relating 
to cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain technology, or blockchain 
applications may be implemented which may directly or indirectly affect or 
restrict cryptographic token holders’ right to acquire, own, hold, sell, convert, 
trade, or use cryptographic tokens.
The uncertainty in tax legislation relating to cryptographic tokens and digital 
assets may expose cryptographic token holders to tax consequences associated 
with the use or trading of cryptographic token.
Digital assets and related products and services carry significant risks. Potential 
purchasers should take into account all of the above and assess the nature 
of, and their own appetite for, relevant risks independently and consult their 
advisers before making any decisions.
Professional advice
You should consult a lawyer, accountant, tax professional and/or any other 
professional advisors as necessary prior to determining whether to purchase 
CRO tokens.

Future of the Internet : Web3
Crypto.com is committed to building the future of the internet : Web3. 
Powered by cryptocurrency, Web3 will be more fair and equitable, owned by 
the builders, creators and users. We build day by day, block by block, to give 
everyone control over their money, data and identity. The journey to build 
Web3 will be long and hard, but we will all look back at this moment and know 
“it was all worth it”.
Our first global brand campaign : Fortune Favours the Brave (with more 
details in the section on Crypto.com Campaign and Partnerships), which 
stars Matt Damon, is directed by Oscar winner Wally Pfister and produced 
by David Fincher, highlights the company’s own ethos, while inspiring those

thousands of years ago.

Problem Statement and Our Strategy
Key Challenges in Driving Crypto Adoption
We see the following key challenges in driving crypto adoption:
User Experience
Value Proposition
Poorly designed user experience does not delight
or satisfy mainstream users
Weak value propositions do not incentivize people 
to use crypto for purposes other 
than speculative trading 
Complexity
Difcult to understand and 
invest for new-to-crypto users
Security
Damaged user conﬁdence from crypto-related
fraud and theft
12
Crypto.com
Our Strategy
To tackle the challenges above, we are offering products along four verticals:
1. Payment
2. Trading
3. Financial Services
4. Metaverse
Our strategy is to leverage payment solutions as the primary tool for driving 
adoption and user acquisition, while building trading and financial services 
solutions as the major sources of revenue. Our NFT platform is a value added 
service that enables users to access the metaverse experiences. This strategy 
creates and self-sustains a virtuous cycle: payment channels bring users onto 
the platform, whereas trading and financial services generate revenue that can 
be reinvested into payment and used to build the ecosystem to offer full-suite 
crypto services.
Our product solutions across four verticals are building up a sustainable 
ecosystem that serves our mission: Accelerate the World’s Transition to 
Cryptocurrency.

We 
have 
completed 
a 
detailed 
security 
assessment, which included external penetration 
testing, threat modeling through to risk control 
reviews. In addition to our own extensive analysis, 
we have also engaged the Kudelski Blockchain 
Security Center to conduct a thorough external security test and full threat 
modeling exercise to ensure the completeness of their security controls.
We have also been rated “Adaptive (Tier 4)” – the highest level possible for 
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity 
Framework and the latest NIST Privacy Framework, developed by the US 
Department of Commerce. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework, originally 
released in 2014, provides a framework of security guidance for how 
private sector organizations can develop, assess and improve their ability 
to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from cyber attacks. 
All of users’ cryptocurrencies are held offline in cold storage. Crypto.com has 
secured a total of USD 750M in cold storage insurance against physical damage 
or destruction, and third-party theft.
For more information on our security & compliance standards, 
please visit our website.
PCI:DSS (Payment Card Industry: Data Security Standard) 
outlines a set of strict requirements set by the payment 
card industry and is designed to ensure that organizations 
which process, store or transmit credit card data maintain 
a highly secure environment, and uphold the highest data 
security and privacy standards. Level 1 is the highest level 
of certification.
